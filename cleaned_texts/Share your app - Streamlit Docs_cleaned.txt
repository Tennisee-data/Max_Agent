Home / Deploy / Stream lit Community Cloud / Share your app Share your app Now that your app is deployed you can easily share it and collaborate on it. But first, let's take a moment and do a little joy dance for getting that app üï∫ üíÉ deployed! Your app is now live at a fixed URL, so go wild and share it with whomever you want. Your app will inherit permissions from your Git Hub repo, meaning that if your repo is private your app will be private and if your repo is public your app will be public. If you want to change that you can simply do so from the app settings menu. You are only allowed one private app at a time. If you've deployed from a private repository, you will have to make that app public or delete it before you can deploy another app from a private repository. Only developers can change your app between public and private.

A private app will not be visible to anyone else unless you grant them explicit permission. You can grant permission by adding them as a developer on Git Hub or by adding them as a viewer on Stream lit Community Cloud. Once you have added someone's email address to your app's viewer list, that person will be able to sign in and view your private app. If their email is associated with a Google account, they will be able to sign in with Google O Auth. Otherwise, they will be able to sign in with single-use, emailed links. Stream lit sends an email invitation with a link to your app every time you invite someone. ÓôÖ Important When you add a viewer to any app in your workspace, they are granted access to analytics for that app as well as analytics for all your public apps. They can also pass these permissions to others by inviting more viewers. All viewers and developers in your workspace are identified by their email in analytics. Furthermore, their emails show in analytics for every app in your workspace and not just apps they are explicitly invited to.
